# Intain Campus FinTech Challenge 2026 | AI Track

## AI Track Problem Statement
**Loan Performance Intelligence Engine**

*Build an ML-first system for loan-data profiling, performance prediction, anomaly detection, scenario simulation, explainability, and grounded LLM-assisted review.*

### Benchmarking lens
The problem is designed to move beyond LLM wrappers. It reflects current market direction in loan analytics: data profiling, prepayment/default prediction, survival or transition modeling, anomaly detection, scenario simulation, explainability, and governed AI copilots.

---

### 1. Challenge Title
**Loan Performance Intelligence Engine**
Build an AI system that profiles messy loan-level data, predicts loan performance, detects anomalies, runs simple scenarios, and explains outputs to a human reviewer.

### 2. Participant Hook
**Can you build a small but serious AI engine for loan-level data?**
This challenge is not about wrapping an LLM API. Participants must build real data-science and ML capabilities, including:
- Data profiling
- Feature engineering
- Supervised prediction
- Time-aware validation
- Anomaly detection
- Explainability
- Model calibration
- Scenario simulation
- LLM-assisted reviewer explanations
- Agentic coding evidence

The LLM can help explain, summarize, retrieve definitions, generate reviewer notes, and assist development, but the core predictive work must come from data science and machine learning.

### 3. Business-Adjacent Context
Loan-level data is the raw material of many financial workflows. A single loan record may describe loan amount, interest rate, origination date, loan term, geography, credit score band, loan-to-value band, payment status, delinquency status, prepayment status, balance, servicer updates, and document status.

**Core question**
Given messy loan-level data and historical performance, can we identify which records are unreliable, which loans are likely to deteriorate, and what the portfolio may look like under different future scenarios?

*Participants do not need structured-finance knowledge. They only need to understand tabular data, model development, time-based outcomes, and explainable AI.*

### 4. Benchmarking Takeaways
The AI track is benchmarked against the current direction of analytics platforms serving loans, private credit, and structured finance.

| Benchmark theme | Implication for the problem statement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data intelligence before modeling** | Require profiling of distributions, missingness, outliers, relationships, association rules, and drift before model training. |
| **Prediction is multi-outcome** | Move beyond one binary risk label to delinquency, default, prepayment, and next-state prediction. |
| **Time-aware modeling matters** | Require a time-aware split and at least one survival, hazard, or transition-style model. |
| **Scenario analytics are table stakes** | Require base, adverse-credit, and high-prepayment scenario projections. |
| **LLM copilots need governance** | Require grounded explanations, prompt logs, human decision control, and examples of rejected LLM output. |

### 5. Source Data
The organizer should provide a curated synthetic or preprocessed dataset for judging. It should be inspired by public loan-level sources but should not require students to register with data portals or understand raw mortgage-performance schemas during the hackathon.
